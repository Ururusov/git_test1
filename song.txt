oooOOaaaOO AfrikaOooOaa
getup and sing
whene snow pud 
 

hallo haallooo 
You're need care
drive too roud

some content
and here!

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
